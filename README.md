# UnitTestDemo

Unit test User Login with UserDefaults

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a way to Unit Tests an existing user flow, through protocols and dependency injection. 
The app is simple, it takes a client through deciding what type of user they want to be, then saves that state with UserDefaults.

Features:

Protocol oriented Unit Testing
Dependency injection

Note:

UserDefaults is unreliable in XCode simulators. Use a real device to reliably see saved state.
